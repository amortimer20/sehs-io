## Code Challenge 2 - Mad Lib

---

### Introduction

A mad lib is a simple word game where the player is asked to provide a number of words such as a noun, food, place, verb, adjective, etc. The player is then provided a silly story that has their words inserted into specific places. **<a href="http://www.madtakes.com/libs/176.html" target="_blank">Try a mad lib here</a>** if you've never played one before.

#### Skills to Practice
