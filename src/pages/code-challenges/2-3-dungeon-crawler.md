## Code Challenge 2.3 - Dungeon Crawler üè∞üêâ

---

### Objective

In your introductory programming course, you learned how to make a lightweight _choose your own adventure_ dungeon crawler program. In this challenge, you will be able to put your own creativity to the test and implement your own version of the dungeon crawler program.

### Skills to Practice

- Writing nested if statements
- Writing compound Boolean logic expressions with `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR)
- Branching with if, else if, and else
- Debugging an application

### Challenge Tasks

- Create a console project named **Challenge 2-3**.
- Game development: Design an engaging dungeon crawler that allows players to make choices and explore different paths. Utilize nested if statements to create intricate levels and scenarios.
- Implement Boolean Logic: Make your game logic more dynamic by using compound Boolean expressions (&& for AND, || for OR) to control the flow of your adventure.
- Track Game Variables: Use at least two numerical variables to manage elements such as player health, inventory, or score. Incorporate at least one boolean variable to handle game states like unlocking doors or triggering traps.
- Use Your Imagination: This is your chance to build an epic story. Whether it‚Äôs battling mythical creatures, discovering hidden treasures, or solving ancient puzzles, make it memorable!
