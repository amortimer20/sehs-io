## Code Challenge 1.8 - Line Slope Calculator

---

### Introduction

When graphing lines in Algebra, it's important to understand how to calculate the slope of a line. To calculate the slope, at least two points must be identified. You can then calculate the slope using the _Slope Formula_. The Slope Formula is defined as:

<div class="my-5">

![Slope Formula](/courses/code-challenges/slope-formula.png)

</div>

where _m_ is the slope, the ordered pair (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) is the first point, and the ordered pair (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is the second point.

### Skills to Practice

- Prompting a user for input
- Saving user input to variables
- Converting input to the correct data type (if necessary)
- Performing arithmetic calculations
- Formatting custom output using variables

### Challenge Tasks

- Create a console project named **Challenge 1-8**.
- Prompt the user to enter four values corresponding to two points of a line i.e. **(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)** and **(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)**.
- Calculate the slope using the Slope Formula.
- Optionally, round the answer to three decimal places.
- Display the calculated slope to the user in a clear and formatted manner.

### Sample Output

```txt
Enter x1: 2 [Enter]
Enter y1: 3 [Enter]
Enter x2: 12 [Enter]
Enter y2: 14 [Enter]
The slope of the line is 1.1
```
