## Code Challenge 1.5 - Tip Calculator

---

### Objective

Create a console application that helps users calculate the tip amount based on their bill subtotal and a given tip percentage.

**Terms**

**Bill/Subtotal** - How much your food and drink cost

**Tip/Gratuity** - How much money you would like to give your server. For example, people typically tip 15% to 20% of the subtotal.

**Total** - The sum of the bill and tip amount.

**Examples**

- A $10 bill with 20% tip = Tip $2; Total $12
- A $25 bill with 18% tip = Tip $4.50; Total $29.50

### Skills to Practice

- Prompting a user for input
- Saving user input to variables
- Converting input to the correct data type (if necessary)
- Performing arithmetic calculations
- Formatting custom output using variables

### Challenge Tasks

- Create a console project named **Challenge 1-4**.
- Prompt the user to enter the bill subtotal.
- Prompt the user to enter the tip percentage as a whole number. For example, 20 means 20%.
- Calculate the tip amount using the formula Tip = Subtotal × (tip percentage / 100).
- Calculate the total amount.
- Display the calculated tip amount and total amount to the user in a clear and formatted manner.
- If you want to ensure your dollar amounts always have two decimal places, search "add leading zeros to double in C#".

### Sample Output

```txt
