## Code Challenge 1.1 - Chain Letter

---

### Introduction

A classic form of spam in the early days of the internet are known as chain letters. A chain letter involves a story and command to send the letter to a number of contacts. Here is a sample:

<div class="text-light p-2 my-2 bg-black">

Hey there! You're the lucky recipient of a chain letter. Please copy this letter and send it to 10 of your friends.

If you ignore this letter, then your favorite song will always be stuck in your head-but you'll forget the lyrics. Also, every time you pour your cereal, you'll run out of milk just before the bowl is full. 

If you complete the instructions I've given you, all your favorite shows will come back for another season, and your pizzas will always have the perfect cheese-to-topping ratio. Remember, the internet overlords are watching!

Break the chain at your own risk!
