## Code Challenge 3.1 - Raffle

---

### Introduction

A raffle is a simple contest where many individuals can submit one or more entries, and a winner is picked at random.

#### Skills to Practice

- Adding elements to an array
- Repeating code with loops
- Generating a random index

### Challenge Tasks

1. Create a console project named **Challenge 3-1**.
2. Let the user input names to enter into the raffle. Enter the names into an array.
3. If you're using a statically sized array, such as with C# or C++, you can set a size/limit of 100 contestants.
4. When the user is finished adding entries, draw a random winner from the array.

#### Sample Output

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-xl-10 offset-xl-1">
        <video src="/courses/code-challenges/code-challenge-3-1-sample.mp4" autoplay loop width="100%"></video>
    </div>
</div>
