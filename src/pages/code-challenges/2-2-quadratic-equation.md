## Code Challenge 2.2 - Quadratic Equation

---

### Introduction

Your task is to create a program that solves quadratic equations using the quadratic formula. Given coefficients a, b, and c, your program should calculate the roots of the equation a<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0.

### Skills to Practice

- Invoking math functions for complex calculations
- Branching with selection statements

### Challenge Tasks

- Create a console project named **Challenge 2-2**.
- Prompt the user to input the coefficients a, b, and c.
- Calculate the discriminant (_b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac_).
- Determine the roots of the equation based on the discriminant:
    - If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.
    - If the discriminant is zero, there is one real root.
    - If the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots.
- Display the roots in a clear format.
