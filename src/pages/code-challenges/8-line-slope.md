## Code Challenge 8 - Line Slope Formula

---

### Introduction

When graphing lines in Algebra, it's important to understand how to calculate the slope of a line. To calculate the slope, at least two points must be identified. You can then calculate the slope using the _Slope Formula_. The Slope Formula is defined as:

<div class="my-5">

</div>

#### Skills to Practice

- Prompting a user for input
- Saving user input to variables
- Performing arithmetic and saving results to variables
- Formatting output using variables

### Challenge Tasks

1. Create a console project named **CodeChallenge8LineSlopeCalculator**.
2. Complete the folowing tasks:
   1. Prompt the user to enter four values corresponding to two points of a line i.e. **(x1, y1)** and **(x2, y2)**.
   2. Calculate the slope using the Slope Formula.
   3. Display the answer to the user. Consider rounding your answer to a decimal place.

#### Sample Output

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-xl-10 offset-xl-1">
        <video src="/courses/code-challenges/code-challenge-8-sample.mp4" autoplay loop width="100%"></video>
    </div>
