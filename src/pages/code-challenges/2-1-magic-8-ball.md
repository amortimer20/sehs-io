## Code Challenge 2.1 - Magic 8-Ball

---

### Introduction

The Magic 8-Ball is a fortune-telling toy. You ask the 8-ball a question, shake it up, and a response is shown in a little window. Some example responses include:

- It is certain.
- Without a doubt.
- Ask again later.
- Cannot predict now.
- Don't count on it.
- Outlook not so good.

#### Skills to Practice

- Writing selection statements
- Generating random numbers

### Challenge Tasks

1. Create a console project named **Challenge 2-1**.
2. Complete the folowing tasks:
   1. Prompt the user to enter a question. You don't need to save the question, because we don't actually use their question in any meaningful way. We're just giving the user hope.
   2. Generate a random number. This random number will match up to some response.
   3. Depending on the random number, output an answer from the examples above. Include them all in your program.

#### Sample Output

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-xl-10 offset-xl-1">
        <video src="/courses/code-challenges/code-challenge-2-1-sample.mp4" autoplay loop width="100%"></video>
    </div>
</div>
