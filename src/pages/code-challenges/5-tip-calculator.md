## Code Challenge 5 - Tip Calculator

---

### Introduction

Let's be honest, you're probably a cheapskate. _You_ need a program that allows you to calculate how much you are supposed to tip.

#### Terms

**Bill/Subtotal** - How much your food and drink cost

**Tip/Gratuity** - How much money you would like to give your server. Usually 18% - 20% of the subtotal.

**Total** - Final cost: bill + tip.

#### Examples

- A $10 bill with 20% tip
  - Tip $2
  - Total $12
- A $25 bill with 18% tip
  - Tip $4.50
  - Total $29.50

#### Skills to Practice

- Getting numeric user input
- Saving user input to variables
- Performing arithmetic
- Formatting strings

### Challenge Tasks

1. Create a console project named **CodeChallenge5TipCalculator**.
2. Complete the folowing tasks:
  1. Prompt the user to enter their bill amount.
  2. Prompt the user to enter their tip percentage as a whole number. For example, 20 means 20%.
  3. Calculate how much the user should tip and the total.
