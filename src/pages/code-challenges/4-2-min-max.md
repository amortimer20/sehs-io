## Code Challenge 4.2 - Min and Max Finder

---

### Objective

Your task is to write a program that calculates the minimum and maximum values in a collection. You will implement two separate functions: one to find the minimum value and another to find the maximum value.

### Skills to Practice

- Defining functions/methods.
- Passing arguments to functions.
- Returning values from functions.
- Iterating through collections.

### Challenge Tasks

- Create a console project named **Challenge 4-2**.
- Define two functions/methods: one to find the minimum value and one to find the maximum value in a collection.
    - If you're using a statically typed language, such as C#, you may specify either an array or a list for the parameter type.
- Example signatures:

**Python**

```py
def find_min(collection):
    # code here
```

**C#**

```cs
int FindMin(int[] collection)
{
    // code here
}

// -or-

int FindMin(List<int> collection)
{
    // code here
}
```
