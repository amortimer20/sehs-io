## Code Challenge 10 - Quadratic Equation

---

### Introduction

The quadratic equation is a fundamental algebra formula for discovering roots of a parabola. This equation seems intimidating to calculate, but the key to it is to first calculate the _discriminant_, or _b squared - 4ac_. Depending on the result, you either need to use both formulas, just one of them, or neither of them.

#### Skills to Practice

- Invoke math functions
- Branching with selection statements

### Challenge Tasks

1. Create a console project named **CodeChallenge10Quadratics**.
2. Complete the folowing tasks:
   1. Prompt the user to enter the values for variables **a**, **b**, and **c**.
   2. Calculate the discriminant
   3. If the discriminant is greater than zero, there are **two roots**. Calculate both formulas.
   4. If the discriminant is equal to zero, there is **one root**. Use either formula.
   5. If the discriminant is negative, there are **no roots**. No need to calculate further.
   6. Output the result(s) to the user.

#### Sample Output
