## C# Fundamentals Part 4 Summary

---

### Defining Methods

- Methods allow for reusable, modular, readable, and efficient code.
- **Method Definition**: Consists of a signature (name, return type, parameters) and a body (code block).
- **Calling Methods**: Methods need to be explicitly called to execute.
- **Return Types**: Specify the type of data a method returns; void indicates no return value.
- **Scope**: Variables inside methods are local; they can only be accessed within that method.

### Method Parameters

- Parameters allow methods to accept input values (arguments) and operate dynamically.
- **Single Parameter**: Methods can accept a single input.
- **Multiple Parameters**: Methods can accept multiple inputs, and the order of arguments matters.
- **Reference Types**: Passing arrays or lists to methods passes references, affecting original objects.

### Designing Applications with Methods

- **Stepwise Refinement**: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps for method assignment.
- **Modular Design**: Creating organized, scalable, and manageable code by assigning specific tasks to methods.

### Search Algorithms

- Search algorithms are procedures for locating specific data within larger datasets.
- **Linear Search**: Checks each element in a list until the target is found or the list ends.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently searches sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Sorting Algorithms

- Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order for easier management and analysis.
- **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly finds and moves the smallest element to the beginning of the list.
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to the end of the list.
