## Introduction to the C# Programming Language

The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 as part of a software development platform known as .NET.

- C# is statically typed, meaning once the data type for a variable is declared, it cannot change.
- C# uses JIT compilation, so code is compiled at runtime.
- The .NET Framework is available on all major platforms.
