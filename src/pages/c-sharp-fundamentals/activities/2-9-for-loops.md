## Activity 2.9 For Loops

---

### Introduction

C# offers several loop constructs to facilitate iteration. While the while loop is versatile enough to handle most iterative tasks, other loops can sometimes achieve the same results with more efficient code.

One such loop is the **for loop**. Although it shares similarities with the while loop, its structure is distinct. A for loop consists of three main components, aside from the for keyword and the code block:

- **Initialization statement**: Executed once at the beginning of the loop, this statement typically initializes a variable used in the loop condition and termination.
- **Condition**: A logical expression evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues; otherwise, it stops. This works similarly to the condition in a while loop.
- **Increment/Decrement expression**: Executed at the end of each iteration, this statement usually updates the variable initialized in the first part.

**Example**: Count up from 1 to 10 with a for loop

```cs
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

**Example**: Count down from 10 to 1 with a for loop

```cs
for (int i = 10; i >= 1; i--)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

#### Skills to Practice

- Writing for loops

---

### Instructions

#### Setup

1. Create a new C# console application. Name the project **2.9 For Loops**.
2. Click Create.

#### Code

```cs
Console.WriteLine("--- Counting Multiples ---");

Console.Write("Choose a number: ");
int number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
int sum = number; // Sum keeps track of current multiple

Console.Write($"How many multiples of {number} would you like listed? ");
int length = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
{
    Console.Write(sum + " "); // Count horizontally
    sum = sum + number;
}

Console.WriteLine("\nPress Enter to continue.\n");
Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine("--- Calculating Exponents ---");

Console.Write("Choose a base number: ");
number = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
int product = number;

Console.Write($"How many exponents of the base {number} would you like listed? ");
length = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

for (int i = 1; i <= length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{number}^{i} = {product}"); // Carat ^ can be used to represent exponents
    product = product * number;
}
```

#### Debug

```txt
--- Counting Multiples ---
Choose a number: 12 [Enter]
How many multiples of 12 would you like listed? 10 [Enter]
12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120
Press Enter to continue.


--- Calculating Exponents ---
Choose a base number: 3 [Enter]
How many exponents of the base 3 would you like listed? 5 [Enter]
3^1 = 3
3^2 = 9
3^3 = 27
3^4 = 81
3^5 = 243
```

### Tips, Tricks, and Reflection

- Remember, you can complete all of these sample programs using a while loop, but some programs you write later on might be more concise when using for loops.
