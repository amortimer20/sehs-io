## Activity 1.3 String Formatting

### Introduction

In the previous activity, we outputted math expressions separately from the strings. While this works, it's not very visually appealing. In programming, we format strings to construct complex text messages. In C#, there are two popular ways to format strings: string concatenation and string interpolation.

String concatenation involves using the plus sign ( + ) to combine data. For example, we can combine `"My name is "` with `"Anthony Mortimer"` using the plus sign:

```cs
"My name is " + "Anthony Mortimer"
```

A newer way to format strings is through a feature called string interpolation. With string interpolation, you prefix a string with the dollar sign ( $ ). Then you use curly braces {} to insert code expressions directly within the string:

```cs
$"My age in months is {30 * 12}."
```

#### Skills to Practice

- Formatting strings using string concatenation
- Formatting strings using string interpolation

### Instructions

#### Setup

1. Create a new C# console application. Name the project **1.3 String Formatting**.
2. Click Create.

#### Code

```cs
// String concatenation - Use the + sign to append math expressions to strings
Console.WriteLine("10 squared is " + (10 * 10)); // It helps to enclose arithmetic in parenthesis
Console.WriteLine();

// Mixing addition and string concatenation together can cause problems.
// You can use parentheses to ensure the addition is not mixed up with concatenation.
Console.WriteLine("I'm 5 foot 10 inches. That's " + (5 * 12 + 10) + " inches.");
Console.WriteLine();

// String interpolation - Prefix the string with $ and insert code in { }.
Console.WriteLine($"If I take out a $1000 loan, and pay $25 each month, I will pay my loan off in {1000 / 25} months.");
Console.WriteLine();

Console.WriteLine("A woodchuck can chuck 32 wood panels every minute.");
Console.WriteLine($"Therefore, a woodchuck can chuck {32 * 60} wood panels every hour.");
```

#### Debug

```txt
10 squared is 100

I'm 5 foot 10 inches. That's 70 inches.

If I take out a $1000 loan, and pay $25 each month, I will pay my loan off in 40 months.

A woodchuck can chuck 32 wood panels every minute.
Therefore, a woodchuck can chuck 1920 wood panels every hour.
```

### Tips, Tricks, and Reflection

- You are welcome to use either technique for string formatting, but this course favors string interpolation. I personally only use concatenation for very basic formatting.
