## Activity 1.8 Math Methods and Random Numbers

---

### Introduction

This lesson introduces you to more methods that you will utilize throughout this course. We will cover a subset of the math methods available in C#, and we will learn how to generate random numbers.

C# provides a number of built-in math methods and constants for performing advanced math operations. Here are a few that we will cover:

- `Math.Round()`
- `Math.Floor()`
- `Math.Ceil()`
- `Math.Sqrt()`
- `Math.Pow()`
- `Math.PI`
