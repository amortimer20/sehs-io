# Activity 1.0 Introduction to JavaScript and Node.js

## Introduction

JavaScript is the programming language of the web. Every single web browser has a version JavaScript built into it. Therefore, every single computer with a web browser can execute JavaScript! Though originally made for the web, JavaScript can be used to build desktop apps, mobile apps, video games, and more.

There are two platforms we can use to run JavaScript apps: we can run JavaScript in our web browsers, and there is also a platform called **Node.js**, or Node for short. Node.js is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript applications _outside_ of a web browser, such as a mobile or desktop app.

JavaScript is everywhere. You've probably used apps that run JavaScript without even knowing:

- Facebook
- AirBnB
- Instagram
- Uber Eats
- Discord
- Twitch
- WhatsApp
- Pretty much everything useful on the web

## Sample Exercise

Try this out: open up Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Firefox. Hit the _F12_ key on your keyboard to open up the developer tools. Find the tab labeled _console_. The developer console allows you to execute JavaScript code.

Type the following line into the console and press _enter_:

```js
alert("Hello!")
```
